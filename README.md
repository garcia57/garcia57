### Thanks for stopping by! &nbsp; ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=garcia57.garcia57&style=flat-square&color=0088cc)
  
I'm a Product Designer currently contracted with [Medicaidsoft, LLC.](https://www.medicaidsoft.com/) in designing a US federal benefit system to assist elderly citizens in obtaining financial aid. 📝

Since childhood, I’ve been driven by a passion for simplicity. It started with my attempts to streamline my mom’s PB&J-making technique—much to her annoyance. Today, that same passion fuels my work as I work with clients to turn innovation ideas into practical, market-ready solutions, proving just how far my PB&J roots have taken me (with far less peanut butter on the counter). 🍞

My journey to a Product Designer has been filled with numerous twists and turns as I've gone from project to project, for which I am immensely grateful for. My top 5 favorite projects I have been able to work on are: 
- Designing over 7+ prototypes, 25+ workflows, 60+ mockup pages, and many wireframes in Figma (constantly iterated until ready to present to stakeholders to save them money by fleshing out how they wanted their software to work exactly).  
- Creating 20-30 line algorithms from 25 pages of Medicaid law to be implemented in some of Medicaidsoft's software (I had to take a mini vacation after this).
- Built CEO and Employee Dashboards (data relevant to the employees' department) with information such as tasks remaining, subscription revenue, real-time case tracking, and other lead/case analytics.
- Builing multiple 300+ Deluge code line functions to connect FluidPay and Zoho Billing (that way the company could take advantage of the lowest fee rates possible and still keep their company workflows)
- Directed the migration of 1000+ Leads and Cases from MyCase to Zoho CRM, through mapping that companies processes at the time and what their future state would be (the company was able to chop off, on average, 45% of their total process time throuhgout their Lead to Case flow).

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I could talk you ear off with what some of the cool things I learned when building the technical architecture for [Senior Financial Aid Advocates, LLC.](https://www.sfaa.info). 
👋
Even with my background, there's a lot I still have yet to learn about and I love that! It's why when I'm not wrapped up in my latest project, I enjoy picking up hobbies I can work on mastering, such as car repair and cooking.

Got a question or want to chat? Feel free to reach out to me on my LinkedIn! I'd be happy to help you in whatever way I can, especially if its a new large project for me to tackle. 🌟
